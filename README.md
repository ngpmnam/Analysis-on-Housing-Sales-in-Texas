# Analysis of Housing Sales in Texas

This project leverages the **txhousing package** in R to analyze housing sales trends across various cities in Texas. The goal is to address the concerns of potential buyers in a simulated scenario. In this scenario, our customers are evaluating different locations, and we help them make informed decisions by comparing key metrics like average and median sales prices, sales volume, and other relevant trends. 

## CUSTOMER INTERESTS
Details on our customers' objectives are fully presented in the [OBJECTIVES.md](https://github.com/ngpmnam/Analysis-on-Housing-Sales-in-Texas/blob/main/OBJECTIVES.md) file. This prompt was originally developed by Professor Zachary Kessler, a faculty member at Dickinson College, and has been slightly rephrased and formatted for clarity and conciseness. 

## Data Source
The [**txhousing dataset**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/txhousing.html) contains housing sales data for cities across Texas from **2000 to 2015**. This dataset includes metrics such as city, year, month, number of sales, median house prices, total sales volume, active listings, and inventory.

## Objectives Summary
- **Analyze growth trends** in housing sales across Texas cities.
- **Provide insights** on differences between median and mean house prices in 2000 and 2015.
- **Help potential buyers** make data-driven decisions by investigating the relationship between active listings and house prices (both mean and median).
- **Present** findings and **recommend** actionable insights to potential buyers through a [**targeted report**](https://github.com/ngpmnam/Analysis-on-Housing-Sales-in-Texas/blob/main/Recommendation%20Report.pdf).

## Key Takeaways
- **Data manipulation** using the **dplyr** package in R and the **lag** function to track price changes over time.
- **Data visualization** with **ggplot2** to highlight growth trends and illustrate the distribution of housing prices across different cities.
