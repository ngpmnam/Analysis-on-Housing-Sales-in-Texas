# CUSTOMER INTERESTS

**First**, the contracting parties are specifically interested in analyzing trends outside the period of the Great Recession, which broadly spanned from 2008 to 2009. They are particularly focused on identifying high-growth cities over this timeframe and would like insights on which areas exhibit the most growth. Please develop a method to effectively highlight these high-growth areas.

**Additionally**, the client is interested in the difference between average and median sales prices to assess if growth may be influenced by outliers. Based on these criteria, evaluate and recommend several cities as potential investment opportunities.

**Second**, the client seeks guidance not only on where to invest but also on when to invest. Please analyze historical data to determine the most advantageous times for buying (low prices) and selling properties. Report your findings and assess whether these trends apply to your recommended cities.

**Finally**, the client wishes to understand whether a relationship exists between the number of available homes in a given month and the median and mean house prices. Identify any such relationship and evaluate if it varies across different cities.
